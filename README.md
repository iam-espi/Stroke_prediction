# Stroke prediction

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset from Kaggle. Exploratory Data Analysis was performed and 4 machine learning models were tested. 

## Disease Understanding

"Normal brain function requires oxygen and nutrients which are supplied by blood through blood vessels. A stroke occurs when there is a disruption of blood flow to the brain. The area of the brain which is deprived of blood is thus damaged, resulting in signs and symptoms of stroke."

According to Ministry of Health Singapore, 1 in 4 people will suffer from a strole in their lifetime. And stroke can happen to anyone regradless of age, gender, ethnicity or socio-economic status. 

## Data Understanding

The dataset was shared in Kaggle by FEDESORIANO:

The author stated that the data came from confidential souce and it is to be used for educational purpose only. 

## Modeling and Evaluation

Data was split into training and test sets. 

Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM and Decision Tree were carried out on the dataset. Logistic Regression and SVM performed better than the other 2 models. 

## Conclusion

The exercise confirmed that stroke can be predicted with machine learning models with relatively good accuracy.
